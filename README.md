## Description

You've just completed your coding bootcamp. Congrats! But now what?
While it's possible to teach yourself how to code, many of us joined
a bootcamp because of the discipline and accountability a class
provides. But once class is over, it can be difficult to continue
learning and practicing.

Git.Commit is created by coding bootcamp grads for coding bootcamp
grads to help you stay motivated and track your progress. Git.Commit
provides practice projects and coding challenges so you can continue
to sharpen your newly acquired skills, build your portfolio, and
attract employers.

## Navigating Your Profile

Your profile will display in-progress projects, completed projects, and your progress displayed in bar graph form. Each project or coding challenge you submit as completed will add one to the count on the graph. This gives you a visual representation of how much effort you have put into each category.
